var L_txt = new Item("L_txt", "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her \
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the \
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is \
the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?' \n\
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day \
made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a \
daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, \
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it \
so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, \
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the \
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A \
WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had \
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch \
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the \
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down \
a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. \n\
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how \
in the world she was to get out again. \n\
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then \
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think \
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had \
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what \
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what \
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at \
the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and \
book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She \
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \
'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did \
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it \
into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. \n\
'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall \
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me \
at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the \
top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n\
Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how \
many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting \
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four \
thousand miles down, I thinkâ€”' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several \
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this \
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as \
there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it \
over) 'â€”yes, that's about the right distanceâ€”but then I wonder what \
Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, \
or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\
Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the \
earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with \
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkâ€”' (she was rather glad \
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the \
right word) 'â€”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, \
you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she \
tried to curtsey as she spokeâ€”fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through \
the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little \
girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I \
shall see it written up somewhere.' \n\
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began \
talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' \
(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at \
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are \
no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's \
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here \
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a \
dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, \
'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, \
it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was \
dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand \
in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, \
tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! \
thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the \
fall was over.\n\
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: \
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another \
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down \
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, \
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my \
ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it \
when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: \
she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row \
of lamps hanging from the roof. \n\
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; \
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, \
trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how \
she was ever to get out again.\n\
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of \
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and \
Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors \
of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the \
key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. \
However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she \
had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen \
inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her \
great delight it fitted! \n\
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not \
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the \
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to \
get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright \
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought \
poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, \
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I \
only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things \
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few \
things indeed were really impossible. \n\
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went \
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at \
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this \
time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here \
before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper \
label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large \
letters.\n\
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was \
not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, \
'and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read \
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, \
and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because \
they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught \
them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it \
too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, \
it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink \
much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to \
disagree with you, sooner or later. \n\
However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to \
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed \
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, \
and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.");

the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?' \n\
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day \
made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a \
daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, \
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it \
so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, \
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the \
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A \
WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had \
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch \
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the \
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down \
a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. \n\
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how \
in the world she was to get out again. \n\
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then \
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think \
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had \
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what \
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what \
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at \
the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and \
book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She \
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \
'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did \
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it \
into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. \n\
'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall \
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me \
at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the \
top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n\
Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how \
many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting \
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four \
thousand miles down, I thinkâ€”' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several \
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this \
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as \
there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it \
over) 'â€”yes, that's about the right distanceâ€”but then I wonder what \
Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, \
or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\
Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the \
earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with \
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkâ€”' (she was rather glad \
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the \
right word) 'â€”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, \
you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she \
tried to curtsey as she spokeâ€”fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through \
the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little \
girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I \
shall see it written up somewhere.' \n\
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began \
talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' \
(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at \
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are \
no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's \
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here \
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a \
dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, \
'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, \
it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was \
dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand \
in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, \
tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! \
thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the \
fall was over.\n\
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: \
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another \
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down \
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, \
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my \
ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it \
when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: \
she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row \
of lamps hanging from the roof. \n\
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; \
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, \
trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how \
she was ever to get out again.\n\
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of \
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and \
Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors \
of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the \
key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. \
However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she \
had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen \
inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her \
great delight it fitted! \n\
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not \
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the \
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to \
get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright \
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought \
poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, \
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I \
only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things \
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few \
things indeed were really impossible. \n\
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went \
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at \
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this \
time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here \
before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper \
label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large \
letters.\n\
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was \
not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, \
'and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read \
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, \
and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because \
they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught \
them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it \
too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, \
it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink \
much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to \
disagree with you, sooner or later. \n\
However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to \
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed \
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, \
and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.");

Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, \
or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\
Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the \
earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with \
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkâ€”' (she was rather glad \
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the \
right word) 'â€”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, \
you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she \
tried to curtsey as she spokeâ€”fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through \
the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little \
girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I \
shall see it written up somewhere.' \n\
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began \
talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' \
(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at \
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are \
no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's \
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here \
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a \
dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, \
'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, \
it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was \
dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand \
in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, \
tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! \
thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the \
fall was over.\n\
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: \
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another \
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down \
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, \
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my \
ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it \
when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: \
she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row \
of lamps hanging from the roof. \n\
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; \
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, \
trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how \
she was ever to get out again.\n\
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of \
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and \
Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors \
of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the \
key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. \
However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she \
had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen \
inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her \
great delight it fitted! \n\
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not \
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the \
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to \
get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright \
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought \
poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, \
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I \
only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things \
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few \
things indeed were really impossible. \n\
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went \
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at \
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this \
time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here \
before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper \
label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large \
letters.\n\
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was \
not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, \
'and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read \
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, \
and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because \
they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught \
them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it \
too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, \
it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink \
much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to \
disagree with you, sooner or later. \n\
However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to \
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed \
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, \
and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.");
var T_txt = new Item("T_txt", "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her \
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the \
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is \
the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?' \n\
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day \
made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a \
daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, \
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it \
so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, \
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the \
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A \
WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had \
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch \
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the \
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down \
a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. \n\
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how \
in the world she was to get out again. \n\
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then \
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think \
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had \
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what \
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what \
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at \
the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and \
book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She \
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \
'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did \
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it \
into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. \n\
'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall \
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me \
at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the \
top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n\
Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how \
many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting \
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four \
thousand miles down, I thinkâ€”' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several \
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this \
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as \
there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it \

However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she \
had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen \
inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her \
great delight it fitted! \n\
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not \
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the \
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to \
get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright \
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought \
poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, \
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I \
only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things \
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few \
things indeed were really impossible. \n\
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went \
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at \
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this \
time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here \
before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper \
label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large \
letters.\n\
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was \
not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, \
'and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read \
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, \
and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because \
they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught \
them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it \
too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, \
it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink \
much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to \
disagree with you, sooner or later. \n\
However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to \
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed \
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, \
and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.");
var W_txt = new Item("W_txt", "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her \
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the \
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is \
the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?' \n\
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day \
made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a \
daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, \
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it \
so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \
'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, \
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the \
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A \
WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, \
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had \
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch \
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the \
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down \
a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. \n\
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how \
in the world she was to get out again. \n\
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then \
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think \
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had \
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what \
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what \
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at \
the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and \
book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She \
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \
'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did \
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it \
into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. \n\
'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall \
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me \
at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the \
top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n\
Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how \
many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting \
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four \
thousand miles down, I thinkâ€”' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several \
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this \
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as \
there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it \
over) 'â€”yes, that's about the right distanceâ€”but then I wonder what \
Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, \
or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\
Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the \
earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with \
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkâ€”' (she was rather glad \
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the \
right word) 'â€”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, \
you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she \
tried to curtsey as she spokeâ€”fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through \
the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little \
girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I \
shall see it written up somewhere.' \n\
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began \
talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' \
(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at \
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are \
no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's \
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here \
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a \
dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, \
'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, \
it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was \
dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand \
in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, \
tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! \
thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the \
fall was over.\n\
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: \
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another \
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down \
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, \
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my \
ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it \
when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: \
she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row \
of lamps hanging from the roof. \n\
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; \
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, \
trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how \
she was ever to get out again.\n\
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of \
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and \
Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors \
of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the \
key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. \
However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she \
had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen \
inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her \
great delight it fitted! \n\
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not \
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the \
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to \
get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright \
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head \
through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought \
poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, \
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I \
only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things \

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went \
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at \

time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here \
